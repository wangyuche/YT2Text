1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
The size of it. It's like the size of my arm.

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,300
As you can see, I'm in London right now.

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,300
And today, I'm on a mission to debunk the myth that London doesn't have good food.

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,300
For the longest time, London has a bad rep when it comes to food.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,100
People just assume that the city is all about fish and chips and overcooked veggies.

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,000
But is London really a gourmet desert?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,500
I mean, I don't know. This is my first day here.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's go on a journey to sample some of the most iconic British dishes.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,900
And we'll see if the myth is true or are we going to be pleasantly surprised. Let's go.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,700
So we're here at our first stop. It's called Polisi.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,200
It's a family-run business.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,800
So as you can see, it's pretty small.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm looking to have some English breakfast here.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,100
And I'm sure it's pretty authentic.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,700
All right, let's go in.

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,200
So first stop, we're getting a full English breakfast.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
We just got in. There was a long line outside.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
The owner is so hospitable.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,100
He offered us free chips or fries, so you call it in the U.S.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,000
But he offered us free chips because he thought we two both looked too skinny.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,600
And he asked everyone to sing Happy Birthday to a girl sitting in the back.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,000
It's Little Sophie's birthday!

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,700
Happy New Year, Sophie! Happy Birthday, please!

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,400
Happy Birthday to you!

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
It's a really good atmosphere inside this restaurant.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,900
Take a slow walk. She's telling me off. She's telling me off.

28
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,900
So in front of me, this is a full English breakfast.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,000
We've got a lot of baked beans with some mushroom, a sausage.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,400
They asked me to choose between a toast and fried bread.

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
And I got the fried bread. There's also a poached egg on top.

33
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,200
And we've also got some ham and two huge pieces of tomato.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,100
I just arrived last night.

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,500
Welcome.

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,200
You've come to a very good place that we would love to see.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
I know, yeah.

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,900
I got a recommendation from a friend we used to live in London.

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure she knows her way around.

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:03:05,500
So first off, I really like the mushroom.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's a great earthy flavor to kick off the whole meal.

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,200
The sausage, it's really crispy on the outside, but juicy on the inside.

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,400
It's got a great savory taste.

44
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,100
It goes well with the bacon and the sausage.

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,700
It complements each other.

46
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,300
It's kind of like you didn't too much meat and you want some veggies on the side.

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,100
I feel like the tomato serves that kind of role.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,800
And I'm going to try the fried toast.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,700
It kind of reminds me of guan cai ban.

50
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,500
This is so good.

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,700
It really reminds me of guan cai ban.

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,500
It comes with butter too.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
So it's got a salty kick.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I honestly don't really like beans.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,900
You can already tell how picky I am.

56
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,700
Sorry.

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,500
I guess I'm just not a huge fan of beans.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,700
For me, beans is just something sweet, I think.

59
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,400
When you have Hong Dou Tang, it should be sweet.

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,700
So the owner mentioned earlier that his grandfather is actually born upstairs.

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,500
The exact same building, the whole family immigrated from Italy in the 1900s.

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,900
The whole molding and like all the woods here was installed during that time.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
Both of us are not a huge fan of beans.

64
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,100
I guess it just doesn't fit our palate that much.

65
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,600
It's not a type of food that we're used to eating.

66
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,700
But other than that, everything is so good.

67
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
I'm very, very impressed.

68
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,100
And also the hospitality here is just, wow, it's overwhelming.

69
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,300
Like everyone's so welcoming.

70
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Not just the owner, like the other customers here.

71
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,900
The food and the people are all just very good, yeah?

72
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,500
So glad I found this place.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,700
So our second stop right here at May Fair Chiffy.

74
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,300
And we're here for the quintessential British dish, the fish and chips.

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,500
And I personally don't eat fish, so I don't know what to expect.

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,700
I'll try to try some just for the sake of the video.

77
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,500
All right, let's go.

78
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,300
First impression of the restaurant.

79
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,500
Looks like a high-end seafood restaurant, actually.

80
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,300
I love the interior.

81
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,100
They also have a lot of paintings, a lot of style in this space.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,500
So we want a May Fair classic.

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
What is the difference?

84
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,500
Oh, really?

85
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Yeah, then I'll definitely go with the cod then.

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,900
And we would also like a scotch egg.

87
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,100
As for drinks, can we just get water?

88
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,900
Yeah, for sure.

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,900
Still is fine.

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Still is fine.

91
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,700
Thank you.

92
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,100
Thank you so much.

93
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:10,900
The front of me is the iconic British dish of fish and chips.

94
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
This is fried cod.

95
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,700
And as you can see, they're different condiments.

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,900
This is the tartare sauce.

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,700
I'm not so sure about this one.

98
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm going to just try a bit.

99
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,500
That was a very honest reaction.

100
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I don't know.

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
This is the Chinese word for it.

102
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
This is so hard to eat.

103
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
This is kind of like green bean paste.

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
But it's savory.

105
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm just not a big fan of it, period.

106
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
And this one, I'm also not so sure from the looks of it.

107
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm just going to try.

108
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Oh, this is the curry sauce.

109
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
The size of it.

110
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
It's like the size of my arm.

111
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I don't even remember the last time I had fish.

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Because I just generally don't eat fish.

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm going to dip it in the tartare sauce.

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
And someone who doesn't eat fish.

115
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm very pleasantly surprised.

116
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
So the taste and the texture.

117
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
The fish is coated in really light and crispy batter.

118
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
It's fried until the outside is crispy.

119
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
But when you bite, the inside is the cod.

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
So it's really soft.

121
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Overall, you get this crispiness and the softness in one bite.

122
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
So it's a really great balance.

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
For someone who doesn't eat fish, I would say.

124
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
It's kind of like, it's so weird to say.

125
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
But it's kind of like chicken.

126
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
My fish usually has a...

127
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
魚臭味.

128
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
I would say it's like a really fishy,

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
ocean-y kind of taste.

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I don't really like it, but for this fish, it's really fresh.

131
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Another way to say it is kind of like a premium version of 麦香魚.

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Or 高級版的麦香魚.

133
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
It's kind of like the same taste.

134
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm trying my best already, okay?

135
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Also the fries, I mean the chips.

136
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I keep on saying fries.

137
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
But the chips are a really good complement to the fish.

138
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
You want some carbs to your meal.

139
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
So overall for me, it's a little bit too much fried food in one meal.

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
But I guess it's like a guilty pleasure.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
And we're sharing the whole thing together, so it's not too bad.

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
And we also ordered scotch eggs.

143
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,500
The outside is a mixture of rice and salmon.

144
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
The outside layer is fried and in the middle,

145
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
it's like a soft-boiled egg.

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
And on the side, there's a...

147
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
I think this is curry mayonnaise.

148
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
And there's a lot of sesame and I believe chives on top.

149
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Mmm.

150
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I feel like I'm talking to myself.

151
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
First impression from someone who doesn't eat fish at all.

152
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I would say it's not fishy.

153
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Which is a compliment.

154
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I like the crispy coat of it.

155
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
And also again, it's like crispy and soft in one bite.

156
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Because inside, the egg is really soft.

157
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,500
But on the outside, if you bite on it, you can actually hear the crunch.

158
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Overall, I really like this one too.

159
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
And I think it goes so well with the curry sauce.

160
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
We just got the bill.

161
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
And there's also this...

162
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I don't know what's inside.

163
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
This is candies.

164
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I feel like a kid in a candy shop.

165
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
So cute.

166
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Thank you so much.

167
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Do you need a seat?

168
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Yeah, sure.

169
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Thank you so much.

170
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Okay, another thing is that...

171
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
We don't need the tip here.

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
So I paid 38 pounds.

173
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
No tip.

174
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I'm not used to it.

175
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
But I think I'm not used to it.

176
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
You don't have to...

177
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Well, you can, but it's not mandatory.

178
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
It's not expected to tip here in England.

179
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
The last stop, we're here to have some British pie.

180
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
The last place we're here at is the jugged hare.

181
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
We actually just randomly walked into this place.

182
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,500
And jugged means that it's cooked and seasoned inside a jar, a container.

183
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
And hare means a big rabbit.

184
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
So apparently there's not a lot of game here.

185
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Game means a rabbit, a deer, a horse.

186
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Like rabbit, deer, horse.

187
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Do I pour this over or do I dip it?

188
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Either way.

189
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Some people pour it to people.

190
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
No problem.

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Is this gravy?

192
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Is this gravy?

193
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,500
So on the side, there's gravy and also mashed potatoes.

194
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
This is the pie.

195
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I didn't expect it to look like this.

196
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
But stuffing is completely inside.

197
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Everything is mashed together.

198
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
So there's pork.

199
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Oh, there's actually black pudding.

200
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
The black pudding is made out of beef or pork blood, I think.

201
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
It's kind of like...

202
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
But I think it's all mushed together so you can't really tell.

203
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
I don't know if I'm eating it right.

204
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
You're supposed to like...

205
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Eat them together, I think.

206
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Wow, it's actually so much better than it looks.

207
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I was actually kind of scared of the black pudding.

208
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
But honestly, it just tastes like braised pork.

209
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
But pulled apart.

210
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,500
And then mushed together with a lot more vegetables.

211
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I actually like it.

212
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I say it does taste a little bit like...

213
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Ma Ling Shu Dun Rou.

214
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Because inside, there's a lot of root vegetables.

215
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
And then you get a lot of the pork.

216
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
It's all pulled apart.

217
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,500
And then it's kind of like a warm stew that you would have during a cold day.

218
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,500
And the outside, the pie, the crust, it's really crispy.

219
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
And it just goes really well with the stew together.

220
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,500
The mashed potato, the texture of it is almost velvety.

221
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
This is really good.

222
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
And you can also taste the butter inside.

223
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
It tastes really good in of itself.

224
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
And if you dip it in the gravy, it's even better.

225
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
So overall, I am very pleasantly surprised.

226
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
So that sums up my London food tour.

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Next week, we're heading to the vintage market to talk to more locals in London.

228
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
I'll see you in my next video.

229
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Bye!
