0	2800	The size of it. It's like the size of my arm.
22800	24800	Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel.
24800	27300	As you can see, I'm in London right now.
27300	32300	And today, I'm on a mission to debunk the myth that London doesn't have good food.
32300	36300	For the longest time, London has a bad rep when it comes to food.
36300	41100	People just assume that the city is all about fish and chips and overcooked veggies.
41100	44000	But is London really a gourmet desert?
44000	46500	I mean, I don't know. This is my first day here.
46500	51000	So let's go on a journey to sample some of the most iconic British dishes.
51000	55900	And we'll see if the myth is true or are we going to be pleasantly surprised. Let's go.
55900	59700	So we're here at our first stop. It's called Polisi.
59700	62200	It's a family-run business.
62200	64800	So as you can see, it's pretty small.
64800	68800	I'm looking to have some English breakfast here.
68800	71100	And I'm sure it's pretty authentic.
71100	72700	All right, let's go in.
79700	83200	So first stop, we're getting a full English breakfast.
83200	86400	We just got in. There was a long line outside.
86400	88400	The owner is so hospitable.
88400	93100	He offered us free chips or fries, so you call it in the U.S.
93100	98000	But he offered us free chips because he thought we two both looked too skinny.
98000	102600	And he asked everyone to sing Happy Birthday to a girl sitting in the back.
102600	106000	It's Little Sophie's birthday!
106000	109700	Happy New Year, Sophie! Happy Birthday, please!
109700	114400	Happy Birthday to you!
118400	121400	It's a really good atmosphere inside this restaurant.
121400	124900	Take a slow walk. She's telling me off. She's telling me off.
124900	126000	Thank you.
126000	128900	So in front of me, this is a full English breakfast.
128900	133000	We've got a lot of baked beans with some mushroom, a sausage.
133000	136400	They asked me to choose between a toast and fried bread.
136500	140500	And I got the fried bread. There's also a poached egg on top.
140500	145200	And we've also got some ham and two huge pieces of tomato.
145200	147100	I just arrived last night.
147100	148500	Welcome.
148500	150200	You've come to a very good place that we would love to see.
150200	151400	I know, yeah.
151400	154900	I got a recommendation from a friend we used to live in London.
154900	157400	Yeah, yeah. I'm sure she knows her way around.
157400	185500	So first off, I really like the mushroom.
185600	188600	It's a great earthy flavor to kick off the whole meal.
188600	193200	The sausage, it's really crispy on the outside, but juicy on the inside.
193200	195400	It's got a great savory taste.
200900	204100	It goes well with the bacon and the sausage.
204100	205700	It complements each other.
205700	210300	It's kind of like you didn't too much meat and you want some veggies on the side.
210300	213100	I feel like the tomato serves that kind of role.
213200	215800	And I'm going to try the fried toast.
216800	220700	It kind of reminds me of guan cai ban.
225300	226500	This is so good.
226500	228700	It really reminds me of guan cai ban.
228700	230500	It comes with butter too.
230500	233000	So it's got a salty kick.
233000	236000	I honestly don't really like beans.
236000	237900	You can already tell how picky I am.
238900	239700	Sorry.
242200	244500	I guess I'm just not a huge fan of beans.
244500	247700	For me, beans is just something sweet, I think.
247700	250400	When you have Hong Dou Tang, it should be sweet.
250400	255700	So the owner mentioned earlier that his grandfather is actually born upstairs.
255700	262500	The exact same building, the whole family immigrated from Italy in the 1900s.
262500	266900	The whole molding and like all the woods here was installed during that time.
267000	269500	Both of us are not a huge fan of beans.
269500	273100	I guess it just doesn't fit our palate that much.
273100	275600	It's not a type of food that we're used to eating.
276100	278700	But other than that, everything is so good.
278700	280100	I'm very, very impressed.
280100	285100	And also the hospitality here is just, wow, it's overwhelming.
285100	287300	Like everyone's so welcoming.
287300	290300	Not just the owner, like the other customers here.
290300	293900	The food and the people are all just very good, yeah?
293900	295500	So glad I found this place.
297500	303700	So our second stop right here at May Fair Chiffy.
303700	308300	And we're here for the quintessential British dish, the fish and chips.
308300	311500	And I personally don't eat fish, so I don't know what to expect.
311500	314700	I'll try to try some just for the sake of the video.
314700	315500	All right, let's go.
318500	320300	First impression of the restaurant.
320300	323500	Looks like a high-end seafood restaurant, actually.
323500	325300	I love the interior.
325300	330100	They also have a lot of paintings, a lot of style in this space.
330100	332500	So we want a May Fair classic.
334500	335900	What is the difference?
339900	340500	Oh, really?
340500	342500	Yeah, then I'll definitely go with the cod then.
343500	345900	And we would also like a scotch egg.
345900	348100	As for drinks, can we just get water?
348100	348900	Yeah, for sure.
348900	349900	Still is fine.
349900	351100	Still is fine.
351100	351700	Thank you.
351700	353100	Thank you so much.
356300	370900	The front of me is the iconic British dish of fish and chips.
370900	372700	This is fried cod.
372700	375700	And as you can see, they're different condiments.
375700	377900	This is the tartare sauce.
377900	379700	I'm not so sure about this one.
379700	381500	I'm going to just try a bit.
386300	389500	That was a very honest reaction.
389500	390500	I don't know.
390500	392500	This is the Chinese word for it.
392500	395500	This is so hard to eat.
395500	397500	This is kind of like green bean paste.
397500	399500	But it's savory.
399500	401500	I'm just not a big fan of it, period.
401500	405500	And this one, I'm also not so sure from the looks of it.
405500	407500	I'm just going to try.
408500	410500	Oh, this is the curry sauce.
410500	412500	The size of it.
412500	414500	It's like the size of my arm.
414500	417500	I don't even remember the last time I had fish.
417500	420500	Because I just generally don't eat fish.
420500	423500	I'm going to dip it in the tartare sauce.
431500	433500	And someone who doesn't eat fish.
433500	436500	I'm very pleasantly surprised.
436500	438500	So the taste and the texture.
438500	442500	The fish is coated in really light and crispy batter.
442500	445500	It's fried until the outside is crispy.
445500	448500	But when you bite, the inside is the cod.
448500	450500	So it's really soft.
450500	454500	Overall, you get this crispiness and the softness in one bite.
454500	456500	So it's a really great balance.
456500	458500	For someone who doesn't eat fish, I would say.
458500	460500	It's kind of like, it's so weird to say.
460500	462500	But it's kind of like chicken.
462500	464500	My fish usually has a...
464500	466500	魚臭味.
466500	468500	I would say it's like a really fishy,
468500	470500	ocean-y kind of taste.
470500	473500	I don't really like it, but for this fish, it's really fresh.
473500	478500	Another way to say it is kind of like a premium version of 麦香魚.
478500	480500	Or 高級版的麦香魚.
480500	482500	It's kind of like the same taste.
482500	484500	I'm trying my best already, okay?
484500	486500	Also the fries, I mean the chips.
486500	488500	I keep on saying fries.
488500	491500	But the chips are a really good complement to the fish.
491500	494500	You want some carbs to your meal.
494500	498500	So overall for me, it's a little bit too much fried food in one meal.
498500	501500	But I guess it's like a guilty pleasure.
501500	504500	And we're sharing the whole thing together, so it's not too bad.
504500	506500	And we also ordered scotch eggs.
506500	510500	The outside is a mixture of rice and salmon.
510500	513500	The outside layer is fried and in the middle,
513500	516500	it's like a soft-boiled egg.
516500	518500	And on the side, there's a...
518500	520500	I think this is curry mayonnaise.
520500	524500	And there's a lot of sesame and I believe chives on top.
529500	531500	Mmm.
533500	535500	I feel like I'm talking to myself.
535500	537500	First impression from someone who doesn't eat fish at all.
537500	539500	I would say it's not fishy.
539500	540500	Which is a compliment.
540500	542500	I like the crispy coat of it.
542500	545500	And also again, it's like crispy and soft in one bite.
545500	547500	Because inside, the egg is really soft.
547500	550500	But on the outside, if you bite on it, you can actually hear the crunch.
550500	552500	Overall, I really like this one too.
552500	555500	And I think it goes so well with the curry sauce.
558500	560500	We just got the bill.
560500	562500	And there's also this...
562500	564500	I don't know what's inside.
566500	568500	This is candies.
571500	573500	I feel like a kid in a candy shop.
574500	576500	So cute.
578500	579500	Thank you so much.
579500	580500	Do you need a seat?
580500	581500	Yeah, sure.
581500	583500	Thank you so much.
583500	585500	Okay, another thing is that...
585500	587500	We don't need the tip here.
587500	589500	So I paid 38 pounds.
589500	591500	No tip.
591500	593500	I'm not used to it.
593500	595500	But I think I'm not used to it.
595500	596500	You don't have to...
596500	599500	Well, you can, but it's not mandatory.
599500	603500	It's not expected to tip here in England.
608500	612500	The last stop, we're here to have some British pie.
618500	621500	The last place we're here at is the jugged hare.
621500	624500	We actually just randomly walked into this place.
624500	630500	And jugged means that it's cooked and seasoned inside a jar, a container.
630500	633500	And hare means a big rabbit.
633500	636500	So apparently there's not a lot of game here.
636500	640500	Game means a rabbit, a deer, a horse.
640500	642500	Like rabbit, deer, horse.
658500	661500	Do I pour this over or do I dip it?
661500	663500	Either way.
663500	665500	Some people pour it to people.
665500	666500	No problem.
666500	667500	Is this gravy?
667500	669500	Is this gravy?
670500	675500	So on the side, there's gravy and also mashed potatoes.
675500	676500	This is the pie.
676500	679500	I didn't expect it to look like this.
679500	682500	But stuffing is completely inside.
682500	684500	Everything is mashed together.
684500	686500	So there's pork.
686500	688500	Oh, there's actually black pudding.
688500	693500	The black pudding is made out of beef or pork blood, I think.
693500	695500	It's kind of like...
695500	698500	But I think it's all mushed together so you can't really tell.
698500	700500	I don't know if I'm eating it right.
700500	703500	You're supposed to like...
703500	705500	Eat them together, I think.
710500	713500	Wow, it's actually so much better than it looks.
713500	717500	I was actually kind of scared of the black pudding.
717500	721500	But honestly, it just tastes like braised pork.
721500	723500	But pulled apart.
723500	727500	And then mushed together with a lot more vegetables.
727500	729500	I actually like it.
729500	732500	I say it does taste a little bit like...
732500	734500	Ma Ling Shu Dun Rou.
734500	738500	Because inside, there's a lot of root vegetables.
738500	740500	And then you get a lot of the pork.
740500	742500	It's all pulled apart.
742500	747500	And then it's kind of like a warm stew that you would have during a cold day.
747500	752500	And the outside, the pie, the crust, it's really crispy.
752500	755500	And it just goes really well with the stew together.
755500	759500	The mashed potato, the texture of it is almost velvety.
759500	760500	This is really good.
760500	762500	And you can also taste the butter inside.
762500	764500	It tastes really good in of itself.
764500	767500	And if you dip it in the gravy, it's even better.
767500	771500	So overall, I am very pleasantly surprised.
771500	773500	So that sums up my London food tour.
773500	777500	Next week, we're heading to the vintage market to talk to more locals in London.
777500	779500	I'll see you in my next video.
779500	780500	Bye!
