00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
The size of it. It's like the size of my arm.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.300
As you can see, I'm in London right now.

00:27.300 --> 00:32.300
And today, I'm on a mission to debunk the myth that London doesn't have good food.

00:32.300 --> 00:36.300
For the longest time, London has a bad rep when it comes to food.

00:36.300 --> 00:41.100
People just assume that the city is all about fish and chips and overcooked veggies.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.000
But is London really a gourmet desert?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.500
I mean, I don't know. This is my first day here.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.000
So let's go on a journey to sample some of the most iconic British dishes.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.900
And we'll see if the myth is true or are we going to be pleasantly surprised. Let's go.

00:55.900 --> 00:59.700
So we're here at our first stop. It's called Polisi.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.200
It's a family-run business.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.800
So as you can see, it's pretty small.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.800
I'm looking to have some English breakfast here.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.100
And I'm sure it's pretty authentic.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.700
All right, let's go in.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.200
So first stop, we're getting a full English breakfast.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.400
We just got in. There was a long line outside.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.400
The owner is so hospitable.

01:28.400 --> 01:33.100
He offered us free chips or fries, so you call it in the U.S.

01:33.100 --> 01:38.000
But he offered us free chips because he thought we two both looked too skinny.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.600
And he asked everyone to sing Happy Birthday to a girl sitting in the back.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.000
It's Little Sophie's birthday!

01:46.000 --> 01:49.700
Happy New Year, Sophie! Happy Birthday, please!

01:49.700 --> 01:54.400
Happy Birthday to you!

01:58.400 --> 02:01.400
It's a really good atmosphere inside this restaurant.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.900
Take a slow walk. She's telling me off. She's telling me off.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.000
Thank you.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.900
So in front of me, this is a full English breakfast.

02:08.900 --> 02:13.000
We've got a lot of baked beans with some mushroom, a sausage.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.400
They asked me to choose between a toast and fried bread.

02:16.500 --> 02:20.500
And I got the fried bread. There's also a poached egg on top.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.200
And we've also got some ham and two huge pieces of tomato.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.100
I just arrived last night.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.500
Welcome.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.200
You've come to a very good place that we would love to see.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.400
I know, yeah.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.900
I got a recommendation from a friend we used to live in London.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.400
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure she knows her way around.

02:37.400 --> 03:05.500
So first off, I really like the mushroom.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.600
It's a great earthy flavor to kick off the whole meal.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.200
The sausage, it's really crispy on the outside, but juicy on the inside.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.400
It's got a great savory taste.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.100
It goes well with the bacon and the sausage.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.700
It complements each other.

03:25.700 --> 03:30.300
It's kind of like you didn't too much meat and you want some veggies on the side.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.100
I feel like the tomato serves that kind of role.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.800
And I'm going to try the fried toast.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.700
It kind of reminds me of guan cai ban.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.500
This is so good.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.700
It really reminds me of guan cai ban.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.500
It comes with butter too.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.000
So it's got a salty kick.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I honestly don't really like beans.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.900
You can already tell how picky I am.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.700
Sorry.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.500
I guess I'm just not a huge fan of beans.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.700
For me, beans is just something sweet, I think.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.400
When you have Hong Dou Tang, it should be sweet.

04:10.400 --> 04:15.700
So the owner mentioned earlier that his grandfather is actually born upstairs.

04:15.700 --> 04:22.500
The exact same building, the whole family immigrated from Italy in the 1900s.

04:22.500 --> 04:26.900
The whole molding and like all the woods here was installed during that time.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.500
Both of us are not a huge fan of beans.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.100
I guess it just doesn't fit our palate that much.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.600
It's not a type of food that we're used to eating.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.700
But other than that, everything is so good.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.100
I'm very, very impressed.

04:40.100 --> 04:45.100
And also the hospitality here is just, wow, it's overwhelming.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.300
Like everyone's so welcoming.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.300
Not just the owner, like the other customers here.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.900
The food and the people are all just very good, yeah?

04:53.900 --> 04:55.500
So glad I found this place.

04:57.500 --> 05:03.700
So our second stop right here at May Fair Chiffy.

05:03.700 --> 05:08.300
And we're here for the quintessential British dish, the fish and chips.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.500
And I personally don't eat fish, so I don't know what to expect.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.700
I'll try to try some just for the sake of the video.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.500
All right, let's go.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.300
First impression of the restaurant.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.500
Looks like a high-end seafood restaurant, actually.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.300
I love the interior.

05:25.300 --> 05:30.100
They also have a lot of paintings, a lot of style in this space.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.500
So we want a May Fair classic.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.900
What is the difference?

05:39.900 --> 05:40.500
Oh, really?

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
Yeah, then I'll definitely go with the cod then.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.900
And we would also like a scotch egg.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.100
As for drinks, can we just get water?

05:48.100 --> 05:48.900
Yeah, for sure.

05:48.900 --> 05:49.900
Still is fine.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.100
Still is fine.

05:51.100 --> 05:51.700
Thank you.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.100
Thank you so much.

05:56.300 --> 06:10.900
The front of me is the iconic British dish of fish and chips.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.700
This is fried cod.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.700
And as you can see, they're different condiments.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.900
This is the tartare sauce.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.700
I'm not so sure about this one.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.500
I'm going to just try a bit.

06:26.300 --> 06:29.500
That was a very honest reaction.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
I don't know.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
This is the Chinese word for it.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.500
This is so hard to eat.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
This is kind of like green bean paste.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.500
But it's savory.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
I'm just not a big fan of it, period.

06:41.500 --> 06:45.500
And this one, I'm also not so sure from the looks of it.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
I'm just going to try.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
Oh, this is the curry sauce.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
The size of it.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
It's like the size of my arm.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.500
I don't even remember the last time I had fish.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
Because I just generally don't eat fish.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.500
I'm going to dip it in the tartare sauce.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
And someone who doesn't eat fish.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.500
I'm very pleasantly surprised.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.500
So the taste and the texture.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.500
The fish is coated in really light and crispy batter.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.500
It's fried until the outside is crispy.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
But when you bite, the inside is the cod.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
So it's really soft.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.500
Overall, you get this crispiness and the softness in one bite.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.500
So it's a really great balance.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.500
For someone who doesn't eat fish, I would say.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
It's kind of like, it's so weird to say.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
But it's kind of like chicken.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
My fish usually has a...

07:44.500 --> 07:46.500
魚臭味.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
I would say it's like a really fishy,

07:48.500 --> 07:50.500
ocean-y kind of taste.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.500
I don't really like it, but for this fish, it's really fresh.

07:53.500 --> 07:58.500
Another way to say it is kind of like a premium version of 麦香魚.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
Or 高級版的麦香魚.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
It's kind of like the same taste.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
I'm trying my best already, okay?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
Also the fries, I mean the chips.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
I keep on saying fries.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.500
But the chips are a really good complement to the fish.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
You want some carbs to your meal.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.500
So overall for me, it's a little bit too much fried food in one meal.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.500
But I guess it's like a guilty pleasure.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.500
And we're sharing the whole thing together, so it's not too bad.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
And we also ordered scotch eggs.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.500
The outside is a mixture of rice and salmon.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.500
The outside layer is fried and in the middle,

08:33.500 --> 08:36.500
it's like a soft-boiled egg.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
And on the side, there's a...

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
I think this is curry mayonnaise.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.500
And there's a lot of sesame and I believe chives on top.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
Mmm.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.500
I feel like I'm talking to myself.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.500
First impression from someone who doesn't eat fish at all.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.500
I would say it's not fishy.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
Which is a compliment.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
I like the crispy coat of it.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.500
And also again, it's like crispy and soft in one bite.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
Because inside, the egg is really soft.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.500
But on the outside, if you bite on it, you can actually hear the crunch.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
Overall, I really like this one too.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.500
And I think it goes so well with the curry sauce.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
We just got the bill.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
And there's also this...

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
I don't know what's inside.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
This is candies.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
I feel like a kid in a candy shop.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
So cute.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
Thank you so much.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.500
Do you need a seat?

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
Yeah, sure.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.500
Thank you so much.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
Okay, another thing is that...

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500
We don't need the tip here.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.500
So I paid 38 pounds.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.500
No tip.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
I'm not used to it.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
But I think I'm not used to it.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
You don't have to...

09:56.500 --> 09:59.500
Well, you can, but it's not mandatory.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.500
It's not expected to tip here in England.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.500
The last stop, we're here to have some British pie.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.500
The last place we're here at is the jugged hare.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.500
We actually just randomly walked into this place.

10:24.500 --> 10:30.500
And jugged means that it's cooked and seasoned inside a jar, a container.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.500
And hare means a big rabbit.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.500
So apparently there's not a lot of game here.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.500
Game means a rabbit, a deer, a horse.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.500
Like rabbit, deer, horse.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.500
Do I pour this over or do I dip it?

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
Either way.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
Some people pour it to people.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
No problem.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.500
Is this gravy?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.500
Is this gravy?

11:10.500 --> 11:15.500
So on the side, there's gravy and also mashed potatoes.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
This is the pie.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.500
I didn't expect it to look like this.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.500
But stuffing is completely inside.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.500
Everything is mashed together.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
So there's pork.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
Oh, there's actually black pudding.

11:28.500 --> 11:33.500
The black pudding is made out of beef or pork blood, I think.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.500
It's kind of like...

11:35.500 --> 11:38.500
But I think it's all mushed together so you can't really tell.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
I don't know if I'm eating it right.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.500
You're supposed to like...

11:43.500 --> 11:45.500
Eat them together, I think.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.500
Wow, it's actually so much better than it looks.

11:53.500 --> 11:57.500
I was actually kind of scared of the black pudding.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.500
But honestly, it just tastes like braised pork.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
But pulled apart.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.500
And then mushed together with a lot more vegetables.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.500
I actually like it.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.500
I say it does taste a little bit like...

12:12.500 --> 12:14.500
Ma Ling Shu Dun Rou.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.500
Because inside, there's a lot of root vegetables.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.500
And then you get a lot of the pork.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
It's all pulled apart.

12:22.500 --> 12:27.500
And then it's kind of like a warm stew that you would have during a cold day.

12:27.500 --> 12:32.500
And the outside, the pie, the crust, it's really crispy.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.500
And it just goes really well with the stew together.

12:35.500 --> 12:39.500
The mashed potato, the texture of it is almost velvety.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
This is really good.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
And you can also taste the butter inside.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.500
It tastes really good in of itself.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.500
And if you dip it in the gravy, it's even better.

12:47.500 --> 12:51.500
So overall, I am very pleasantly surprised.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.500
So that sums up my London food tour.

12:53.500 --> 12:57.500
Next week, we're heading to the vintage market to talk to more locals in London.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.500
I'll see you in my next video.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
Bye!
